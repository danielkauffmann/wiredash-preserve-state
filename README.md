# AutoRoute preserve state with Wiredash demo

This is a demo
for [the current opened issue.](https://github.com/Milad-Akarie/auto_route_library/issues/1685)

Note: Please observe the logs generated by the BlocObserver in the console in order to identify the
moments when the example Bloc created in the demo is initialized and closed. It should ideally be
created only once.
